        Based on ICML workshop which produces a match that has users either getting 4 or 6 papers with one user
        getting just 2.
        There are 44 papers, 27 reviewers. 3 users per paper and between 4 and 6 papers per user.
        All reviewers are 0 cost.
        Purpose:  Make sure all reviewers get between their min and max
        TODO Why do all reviewers get either the min or max?  None of them get a number in between!
