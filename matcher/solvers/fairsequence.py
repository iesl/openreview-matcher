    Assign reviewers using a modified version of the Greedy Reviewer Round-Robin algorithm
    from I Will Have Order! Optimizing Orders for Fair Reviewer Assignment
    (https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02126). This algorithm outputs an assignment that satisfies
    the weighted envy-free up to 1 item (WEF1) criterion. Each paper i has a "weight" equal to
    its demand for reviewers (k_i), and for all i, i's score for its own reviewers (v_i(A_i))
    is greater than or equal to (k_i/k_j)*v_i(A_j - r) for any paper j and some r given to j.

    Reviewers are assigned to papers one-by-one in priority order, with priority given to the papers with the
    lowest ratio of allocation size to demand. Ties in priority are resolved by assigning the reviewer-paper
    pair with the highest affinity. Some constraints apply to the selection process - most importantly,
    no paper can be assigned a reviewer that would cause a WEF1 violation. If this procedure fails to
    discover a complete, WEF1 allocation, we try the picking sequence again, allowing WEF1 violations
    during the process.
